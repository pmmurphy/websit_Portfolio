			<h2>Mission</h2>


				<p id="mission" class="mission">Our mission is to rescue and establish assurance colonies of amphibian species that are in extreme danger of extinction throughout Panama. We will also focus our efforts and expertise on developing methodologies to reduce the impact of the amphibian chytrid fungus (Bd) so that one day captive amphibians may be re-introduced to the wild.</p>

			<h2>Vision</h2>	

				<p id="vision" clas="vision">The Panamanian Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project will be a sustainably financed, Panamanian-led organization that has stemmed the tide of extinctions caused by amphibian chytrid fungus and other threats to amphibians. We will lead successful recovery programs for Panama's endangered amphibians and serve as an exemplary model that can be replicated to address the threat of chytridiomycosis to the survival of amphibians worldwide.</p>
